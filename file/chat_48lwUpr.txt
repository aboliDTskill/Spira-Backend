ðŸŒŸ Welcome to our interactive session! ðŸŒŸ

Today, we will be discussing the topic of "India's Location" based on the PDF uploaded. This unit explores the geographical location of India, its physical environment, and its relationship with neighboring countries. 

Here are three sample questions to get us started:

1. What is the reason for the difference between the latitudinal and longitudinal extent of India?
2. Why is the standard meridian important in determining time zones in India?
3. Name a few places in India through which the standard meridian passes.

Feel free to ask any questions or share your thoughts on the topic. Let's dive in and explore the fascinating aspects of India's location together!
